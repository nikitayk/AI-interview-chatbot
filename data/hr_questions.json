  },
  {
    "question": "How do you handle imbalanced datasets in classification problems?",
    "model_answer": "Handling imbalanced datasets can involve techniques such as resampling (oversampling minority or undersampling majority), generating synthetic samples using SMOTE, using appropriate evaluation metrics like F1-score or AUC instead of accuracy, and applying cost-sensitive learning to penalize misclassification of minority classes more.",
    "difficulty": "medium"
  },
  {
    "question": "What is cross-validation, and why is it important?",
    "model_answer": "Cross-validation is a technique to assess how well a model generalizes to unseen data by dividing data into multiple folds, training on some folds, and validating on the others. It helps prevent overfitting and provides a more reliable estimate of model performance.",

  {
    "question": "Describe the difference between bagging and boosting.",
    "model_answer": "Bagging (Bootstrap Aggregating) trains multiple independent models on different subsets of data and averages their predictions to reduce variance, e.g., Random Forest. Boosting trains models sequentially, where each model focuses on correcting errors of the previous one, reducing bias, e.g., AdaBoost or Gradient Boosting.",
    "difficulty": "medium"
  },
  {
    "question": "What considerations do you keep in mind when selecting a model evaluation metric?",
    "model_answer": "I consider the problem type (classification or regression), class imbalance, cost of false positives vs false negatives, and business objectives.
