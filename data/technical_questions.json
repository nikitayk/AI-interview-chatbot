      "answer": "Supervised learning involves training a model on labeled data, where each input has a corresponding output label. The model learns to map inputs to outputs. Unsupervised learning, on the other hand, deals with unlabeled data, and the model tries to find hidden patterns or intrinsic structures within the data.",
